# Angular Web and Mobile

![nativescript-loves-angular](./images/nativescript-loves-angular.png?raw=true)

Since the beginning of Angular, you could use [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) with Angular to build mobile apps.

> NativeScript is an open source framework for building truly native mobile apps with JavaScript. It let's you use your existing Angular skills, and as a result you get a native UI & performance on iOS and Android.

However, when you needed to build both a web and a native mobile app, you had to create two separate projects. With the dawn of **Schematics** and **ng add** this has changed.

The Angular and NativeScript teams teamed up to create [nativescript-schematics](https://github.com/nativescript/nativescript-schematics), a schematic that enables you to build both web and mobile apps from a single project.

> Please note that **@nativescript/schematics** works with **@angular/cli 6.1.0** or newer.

We are looking here at a scenario where you can use the Angular CLI with the {N} schematic to, either:

 * create a new project with a code-sharing structure, or
 * convert an existing web project to a code-sharing structure.

Then: 
 
 * convert components and modules to a code-sharing format,
 * generate new components and modules in a code-sharing format.

## Code-Sharing Project

A code-sharing project is one where we keep the code for the web and mobile apps in one place. Hereâ€™s a quick diagram to show you what that looks like at a high level.

![project-structure](./images/project-structure.png?raw=true)

The objective is to share as much code as possible, and separate the platform-specific code into separate files.

This usually means that we can share the code for:

 * **Routes** for navigation,
 * **Services** for common business logic,
 *  and **Component Class definition** for common behaviour of a component

While, separating the code for:

 * **UI Layer** (**stylesheets** and **html**) - as you need to use different user interface components in web and NativeScript-built native apps,
 * and **NgModules** - so that we can import platform specific modules, without creating conflicts (i.e. Angular Material Design - which is web only) between web and mobile.

### Create project

To get started we could either create a new project with a code-sharing structure. Just run `ng new` with **@nativescript/schematics** as the collection.

Just like this:

```
ng new --collection=@nativescript/schematics --name=app-name --shared
```
> Note, you may need to install **@nativescript/schematics** first:
> 
> ```bash
> npm i -g @nativescript/schematics
> ```

Or we could extend an existing web projects with the capability to build Mobile apps with NativeScript, by simply calling:

```bash
ng add @nativescript/schematics
```

This adds the NativeScript specific npm modules, add a default **AppModule** and **AppComponent** definition (or whatever you called your entry module and entry component) and adds another tsconfig.json (for NativeScript).

## Code Separation

Before we can start code-sharing, we need to know how to separate the web code from the mobile code. This is important, so that we could easily create a platform specific code without creating conflicts.

To do that we can use a simple **naming convention**. By adding a **.tns** before the file extension, you can indicate that this file is NativeScript specific, while the same file without the **.tns** extension is marked as web specific. If we have just one file without the **.tns** extension, then this makes it a shared file.

## Component - Code-Sharing Format

![code-separating](./images/code-separation.png?raw=true)

The most common scenario is a component code. Usually we would have:

 * **name.component.ts** -  a shared file for the Component Class definition,
 * **name.component.html** - a web specific template
 * **name.component.tns.html** - a mobile specific template
 * **name.component.css** - a web specific stylesheet
 * **name.component.tns.css** - a mobile specific stylesheet

What is interesting here, is that in our **@Component** Decorator references the template and stylesheet files without including the **.tns** extension, as this is something that is handled by the build process.

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-name',
  templateUrl: './name.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./name.component.css'],
})
```

<!--## Example - App With Login

Let's consider a scenario for an app with a Login and Home Components, User Service and Routes configuration for Navigation purposes.-->


## Build Process

![build-process](./images/build-process.png?raw=true)

To complete the story, we need a build process that is capable of using the shared files and the platform specific ones, and provide a web or a mobile app as a result.

### Building for Web

To build a web app, it is "Business as usual", just use the Angular CLI to do the job.
When you call `ng serve` or `ng build`, the Angular CLI will ignore all NativeScript specific files - as none of the web files would directly reference any **.tns** files.

 > `ng serve` -> builds a web app from a code-sharing project

For AOT builds, you may need to give TypeScript a helping hand, by adding NativeScript extensions to **tsconfig.json** exclude list.

```ts
"exclude": [
  "**/*.ns.ts",
  "**/*.tns.ts",
  "**/*.android.ts",
  "**/*.ios.ts"
]
```

### Building for Mobile

In order to build an iOS or an Android app with NativeScript, we need to use the [NativeScript CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript) with the [NativeScript Webpack plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-dev-webpack).

Call:

 * `tns run ios --bundle` - to build an iOS app from the code-sharing project
 * `tns run android --bundle` - to build an Android app from the code-sharing project

During the build process, Webpack takes care of providing the **.tns** files whenever they are available, and as a result hiding the web versions of the same files (virtually, files like **home.component.tns.html** become **home.component.html**). While the NativeScript CLI is responsible for building a native mobile app.

## Code Separation for NgModules: HttpClient
Code separation is useful when working with NgModules, as often you need to import web- or NativeScript-specific modules.

A very good example is when you need to make an http call. In a web app you need to import the **HttpClientModule**, which  provides you with the implementation for the **HttpClient**.

However, the way http calls are executed in a browser is different to how they work in iOS and Android. In NativeScript you should use the **NativeScriptHttpClientModule**, which provides us with the equivalent implementation for the **HttpClient**.

Now, you can use the code separation technique to create two versions of the **@NgModule** - each using a different version of the **HttpClientModule** - and then with the help of Dependency Injection provide the right implementation of the **HttpClient** into your service.

![module-separation](./images/ngmodule-http.png?raw=true)

 * **my.module.ts** - a web module file that imports the **HttpClientModule**

```ts
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'; 

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    HttpClientModule,
    ...
  ]
  ...
})
export class MyModule { }
```

 * **my.module.tns.ts** - a mobile module file that imports the **NativeScriptHttpClientModule**

```ts
import { NativeScriptHttpClientModule } from 'nativescript-angular/http-client';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NativeScriptHttpClientModule,
    ...
  ]
  ...
})
export class MyModule { }
```

 * **my.service.ts** - a shared service file that injects the **HttpClient**

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Injectable()
export class MyService {

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }
  ...
}
```

 > Code separation for modules makes up for a simple and a quite elegant solution. It enables you to bring in functionality that has different implementation (for the web and mobile apps) under one hood and as a result maximise the shared code.

## Summary

As you can see, building for both web and mobile from a single project is fairly straight forward. You can either start with a fresh project (using `ng new`) or add mobile to an existing project (using `ng add`). There is also a simple naming convention to enable code separation, which allows you to cover many scenarios.

Go ahead and give it a try. It really is that simple. You are only one simple `ng add` or `ng new` away from the wonders of code-sharing in Angular.

We would love to hear from you, let us know what works for you, what doesn't and how things could be improved. Any constructive feedback is always welcome.
